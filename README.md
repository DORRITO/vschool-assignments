Exercises and projects chronicling a learning process from no experience in full MEAN stack through a 3 month learning process.

This is my first big, focused learning project!  I am excited to be in this program, and am finally doing what I've always wanted to.

This class moves incredibly fast! After course completion, I will be going back and commenting my code more.  Uncommented code is a sin I just cannot abide.
